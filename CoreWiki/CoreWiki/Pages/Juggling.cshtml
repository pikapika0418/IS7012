                        Juggling is a physical skill, performed by a juggler,
                        involving the manipulation of objects for recreation, entertainment, art or sport.
                        The most recognizable form of juggling is <span>

                            </a>
                        </span>. Juggling can be the manipulation of one object or many objects at the same time,
                        most often using one or two hands but also possible with feet.
                        Jugglers often refer to the objects they juggle as props.
                        The most common props are balls, clubs, or rings.
                        Some jugglers use more dramatic objects such as knives, fire torches or chainsaws.
                        The term juggling can also commonly refer to other prop-based manipulation skills,
                        such as diabolo, plate spinning, devil sticks, poi,
                        cigar boxes, contact juggling, hooping, yo-yo, and hat manipulation.

                        The words juggling and juggler derive from the Middle English jogelen 
                        ("to entertain by performing tricks"), which in turn is from the Old French jangler. 
                        There is also the Late Latin form joculare of Latin joculari, meaning "to jest".[1] 
                        Although the etymology of the terms juggler and juggling in the sense of manipulating objects 
                        for entertainment originates as far back as the 11th century, the current sense of to juggle, 
                        meaning "to continually toss objects in the air and catch them", originates from the 
                        late 19th century.[2][3]

                        From the 12th to the 17th century, juggling and juggler were the terms most consistently used to
                         describe acts of magic, though some have called the term juggling a lexicographical nightmare, 
                         stating that it is one of the least understood relating to magic. In the 21st century, the term 
                         juggling usually refers to toss juggling, where objects are continuously thrown into the air 
                         and caught again, repeating in a rhythmical pattern.[2][4][5]

                        According to James Ernest in his book Contact Juggling, most people will describe juggling as 
                        "throwing and catching things"; however, a juggler might describe the act as "a visually complex 
                        or physically challenging feat using one or more objects".[6] David Levinson and Karen Christensen 
                        describe juggling as "the sport of tossing and catching or manipulating objects [...] 
                        keeping them in constant motion".[7] "Juggling, like music, combines abstract patterns 
                        and mind-body coordination in a pleasing way."[8]
